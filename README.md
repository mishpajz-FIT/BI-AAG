# BI-AAG

This course focuses on automata theory and formal languages.

This repository is an implementation of some algorithms for finite automata in C++ for a homework task.

### Task assignment

The goal of this task was to implement the intersection and unification of non-deterministic automata (using parallel composition). 
The automata had to be subsequently determinized (using [powerset construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerset_construction)) and minimized (using [Hopcroft's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFA_minimization#Hopcroft's_algorithm)).

### Evaulation

The final score for my homework was 10/10 points.
